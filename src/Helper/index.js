How it works for you

The high efficiency softening resin, ensures that you have soft water throughout your house. The resin removes Calcium, Magnesium and Iron (specific to SFT-200Fe) by replacing them with Sodium ions, hence treating your water for hardness and iron problems

Removes iron in addition to Calcium & Magnesium ions and prevents resin fouling from heavy metals ( up to a maximum of 3ppm)

Reduces salt consumed per regeneration by 20-50%

Uses 40-80% less water compared to conventional systems.

The SFT series comes with a designer look with a sleek state of the art compact single tank design. It is made available in two models

SFT-200: Uses Ion Exchange Technology to remove Calcium & Magnesium ions making your water soft & supple.

SFT-200Fe : Uses unique Shallow Shell Technology resin to remove Calcium, Magnesium & Iron ions from your water using Ion Exchange Technology.
