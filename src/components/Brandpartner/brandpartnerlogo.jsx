            The<span>EBARA</span>Corporation is a Japanese multinational. Like every multinational corporation, it has a unique story. The EBARA story starts Issey Hatakeyama, brand founder, who in 1912 founded the Inokuty Type Machinery Office with Prof. Ariya Inokuchi’s theory on centrifugal pumps in mind. Adapting to changes that unfolded over the course of centuries, EBARA kept the idea of Netsu to Makoto (passion and dedication) in its business. These values are still demonstrated by our more than 16,000 employees all over the world.
            EBARA has a global network consisting of more than 80 subsidiaries, 50 of which are consolidated companies, and a number of affiliates specialising in water treatment, environmental engineering systems and precision machinery.
